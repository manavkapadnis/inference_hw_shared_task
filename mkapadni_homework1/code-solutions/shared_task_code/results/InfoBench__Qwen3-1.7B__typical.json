Latin Origin**\nThe word **\"oblique\"** is derived from the Latin **\"obliquus\"**, which means \"slanting\" or \"tilted.\" The Latin term itself comes from the root **\"ob-\"** (meaning \"toward\" or \"across\") and **\"liquus\"** (meaning \"to flow\" or \"to move\").

Meaning in English**\nIn modern English, **\"oblique\"** has the following meanings:\n- **Slanting** or **tilted**: A line or surface that is not straight.\n- **Diagonal**: A line or angle that is not horizontal or vertical.\n- **Non-rectangular**: Not aligned with the axes of a coordinate system.\n- **Unbalanced**: Not evenly distributed or symmetrical.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Historical Usage and Context**\n- **In Geometry**: The term \"oblique\" was used to describe triangles and other shapes that are not right-angled. For example, an **oblique triangle** is a triangle with no right angles.\n- **In Astronomy**: The term was used to describe the movement of celestial bodies that are not aligned with the Earth's axis.\n- **In Philosophy**: The word was used to describe ideas or concepts that are not directly related or not aligned with a clear, direct cause.\n\n---\n\n### **6.

His early life was shaped by the values of his father, a colonial militia leader and a man of strong principles. Raised in a household that valued education, discipline, and duty, Washington was educated at the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University) and later at the College of New France (now the University of Virginia). His relationship with his mother, Martha, was central to his upbringing. Martha was a woman of great intellect and influence, and her presence in his life instilled in him a deep respect for family, tradition, and the importance of hard work. Her death in 1759 left a lasting impact on Washington, shaping his personal philosophy of loyalty and perseverance.\n\n**Revolutionary War Leadership**  \nDuring the Revolutionary War, Washington's leadership was defined by his commitment to the cause of independence. He was appointed commander of the Continental Army in 1775, a role that tested his ability to lead under immense pressure. His relationship with Alexander Hamilton, though complex, was crucial in shaping his professional development. Hamilton, a key figure in the early years of the republic, provided Washington with strategic insight and support. Their relationship, marked by both collaboration and conflict, influenced Washington’s approach to military strategy and leadership. Washington’s ability to maintain morale and cohesion among his troops, despite the challenges of the war, was a testament to his personal resilience and leadership. His decisions during the war, such as the Battle of Trenton and the Battle of Yorktown, were guided by his deep understanding of the people he led and the values he held.\n\n**Presidency**  \nAs the first president of the United States, George Washington faced the monumental task of establishing the new nation. His relationship with Thomas Jefferson, though distant, played a role in shaping his vision for the country. Jefferson, a fellow Virginian and a key figure in the development of the Declaration of Independence, influenced Washington’s understanding of governance and the role of the executive branch. Washington’s presidency was marked by his commitment to democracy, the rule of law, and the preservation of American independence. His leadership during the War of 1812 and his efforts to maintain a strong national identity reflected his enduring influence and the values he had cultivated throughout his life. Washington’s legacy, shaped by his relationships with those who influenced him, remains a cornerstone of American history.",

Physical and Chemical Properties**\n\n**Physical Properties:**\n- **Odorous**: Sodium chloride has a distinct, sharp taste and odor.\n- **Crystalline**: It is a solid at room temperature and forms a crystalline structure.\n- **Hygroscopic**: It readily absorbs moisture from the air.\n\n**Chemical Properties:**\n- **Soluble in Water**: Sodium chloride is highly soluble in water, dissolving to form a clear, colorless solution.\n- **Neutral pH**: It is neutral in nature and does not change the pH of aqueous solutions.\n- **Stable under Normal Conditions**: Sodium chloride is stable under normal storage conditions and does not decompose when exposed to heat or light.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Potential Hazards**\n\nSodium chloride is a common compound and is generally considered **non-toxic** in normal use. However, it can pose the following risks:\n\n- **Skin Contact**: Prolonged or severe skin contact with sodium chloride may cause irritation or burns.\n- **Inhalation**: Inhaling sodium chloride dust or fumes can cause respiratory irritation.\n- **Ingestion**: Ingesting large amounts of sodium chloride may cause gastrointestinal discomfort, but it is not typically toxic in normal use.\n- **Allergic Reactions**: Some individuals may experience allergic reactions to sodium chloride, though this is rare.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Handling and Storage Procedures**\n\n**Handling:**\n- Sodium chloride should be handled with care to avoid skin contact, eye irritation, and inhalation.\n- It should be stored in a dry, well-ventilated area to prevent moisture absorption.\n- It should be kept away from heat sources and direct sunlight to prevent degradation.\n\n**Storage:**\n- Store in a sealed container to prevent moisture and contamination.\n- Keep out of reach of children and pets.\n- Avoid using in quantities that could lead to accidental ingestion.\n\n---\n\n### **4.
