The riddle cleverly uses wordplay—“I have a hat” refers to the pig’s straw hat (a common image), “speak without a mouth” could refer to the pig’s actions or the story’s narrative voice, and “walk without feet” is a misdirection, as pigs do walk on feet.

      "pred": "system\nYou are Qwen, a helpful assistant.\nuser\nInstruction: You are given some reviews for a movie. Each review might have mentioned some negative or positive points about the movie. Read them carefully and extract the positive and negative points mentioned in all of the reviews. Then, make a list of these points and summarize them as positive points and negative points.\nQuestion: Review 1: I'm not sure if it's just the fact that Ed Norton really grates on me in this film, but I never really bought into the idea of Fight Club being some kind of cultural phenomenon. Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?! The visual effects are fascinating and the story is compelling until the second half. Unfortunately, it doesn't end well.\nGeneration:\nassistant\nBased on the provided reviews, here is a detailed extraction and summarization of the **positive** and **negative** points mentioned about the movie *Fight Club*.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Positive Points (Positive Aspects Mentioned in Reviews)**\n\n1. **Innovative Storytelling**  \n   - Review 1: \"Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography.\"  \n   - Review 4: \"The story is compelling until the second half.\"  \n\n2. **Strong Script and Engaging Characters**  \n   - Review 1: \"told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography.\"  \n\n3. **Excellent Cinematography**  \n   - Review 1: \"intense cinematography.\"  \n\n4. **Great Acting**  \n   - Review 3: \"great acting\"  \n\n5. **Compelling and Thought-Provoking Theme**  \n   - Review 2: \"The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world...\"  \n   - Review 3: \"Despite a good theme...\"  \n\n6. **Important Messages**  \n   - Review 3: \"important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way\"  \n\n7. **Fascinating Visual Effects**  \n   - Review 4: \"The visual effects are fascinating\"  \n\n8. **Entertaining and Interesting**  \n   - Review 3: \"majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting\"  \n\n9. **Respect for the Film’s Craft**  \n   - Review 1: \"I have huge respect for the way this film was made\"  \n\n---\n\n### ❌ **Negative Points (Negative Aspects Mentioned in Reviews)**\n\n1. **Feels Overrated**  \n   - Review 1: \"I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\"  \n   - Review 3: \"I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\"  \n\n2. **Loses Audience Connection**  \n   - Review 3: \"fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion.\"  \n\n3. **Becomes Tedious Toward the End**  \n   - Review 1: \"starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end.\"  \n\n4. **Childish and Contrived**  \n   - Review 1: \"Everything just becomes a little bit",

The 5-4-3-2-1 technique interrupts this by redirecting attention to immediate, tangible sensory experiences.\n  \n- **Activates the Parasympathetic Nervous System**: Focusing on physical sensations helps shift your body from a \"fight-or-flight\" state (sympathetic) to a \"rest-and-digest\" state (parasympathetic), reducing heart rate, breathing rate, and muscle tension.\n\n- **Builds Present-Moment Awareness**: By engaging the senses, you train your brain to notice what’s actually happening right",

Come up with the useful links about the given search term.\nQuestion: sql find duplicate values\nGeneration:\nassistant\nTo find duplicate values in SQL, you can use several approaches depending on your database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.). Below are the most common and useful methods, along with relevant documentation links and explanations.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ How to Find Duplicate Values in SQL\n\n#### 1. **Using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`**\nThis is the most common and widely supported method.\n\n```sql\nSELECT column_name\nFROM table_name\nGROUP BY column_name\nHAVING COUNT(*) > 1;\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `GROUP BY` groups rows that have the same value in the specified column.\n- `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1` filters groups where the count of rows is more than one — indicating duplicates.\n\n**Example:**\n```sql\nSELECT email\nFROM users\nGROUP BY email\nHAVING COUNT(*) > 1;\n```\n\n> This returns all emails that appear more than once in the `users` table.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Using Window Functions (`ROW_NUMBER()` or `RANK()`)**\n\nThis method identifies duplicates by assigning a row number to each occurrence.\n\n```sql\nSELECT column_name\nFROM (\n    SELECT column_name,\n           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY id) as rn\n    FROM table_name\n) t\nWHERE rn > 1;\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `PARTITION BY column_name` groups rows by the column you're checking.\n- `ROW_NUMBER()` assigns a unique number to each row within the group.\n- Rows with `rn > 1` are duplicates.\n\n> This is useful when you want to identify duplicates and keep only one instance (e.g., for deduplication).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Using `EXISTS` or Correlated Subqueries**\n\n```sql\nSELECT column_name\nFROM table_name t1\nWHERE EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1\n    FROM table_name t2\n    WHERE t2.column_name = t1.column_name\n    AND t2.id != t1.id\n);\n```\n\n> This checks if a value appears more than once by comparing with another row.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 Useful Documentation Links\n\n1. **MySQL Documentation – GROUP BY and HAVING**\n   - [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-by.html](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-by.html)\n\n2. **PostgreSQL Documentation – GROUP BY and HAVING**\n  ",

Below are the most common and useful methods, along with relevant documentation links and explanations.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ How to Find Duplicate Values in SQL\n\n#### 1. **Using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`**\nThis is the most common and widely supported method.\n\n```sql\nSELECT column_name\nFROM table_name\nGROUP BY column_name\nHAVING COUNT(*) > 1;\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `GROUP BY` groups rows that have the same value in the specified column.\n- `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1` filters groups where the count of rows is more than one — indicating duplicates.\n\n**Example:**\n```sql\nSELECT email\nFROM users\nGROUP BY email\nHAVING COUNT(*) > 1;\n```\n\n> This returns all emails that appear more than once in the `users` table.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Using Window Functions (`ROW_NUMBER()` or `RANK()`)**\n\nThis method identifies duplicates by assigning a row number to each occurrence.\n\n```sql\nSELECT column_name\nFROM (\n    SELECT column_name,\n           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY id) as rn\n    FROM table_name\n) t\nWHERE rn > 1;\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `PARTITION BY column_name` groups rows by the column you're checking.\n- `ROW_NUMBER()` assigns a unique number to each row within the group.\n- Rows with `rn > 1` are duplicates.\n\n> This is useful when you want to identify duplicates and keep only one instance (e.g., for deduplication).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Using `EXISTS` or Correlated Subqueries**\n\n```sql\nSELECT column_name\nFROM table_name t1\nWHERE EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1\n    FROM table_name t2\n    WHERE t2.column_name = t1.column_name\n    AND t2.id != t1.id\n);\n```\n\n> This checks if a value appears more than once by comparing with another row.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 Useful Documentation Links\n\n1. **MySQL Documentation – GROUP BY and HAVING**\n   - [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-by.html](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-by.html)\n\n2. **PostgreSQL Documentation – GROUP BY and HAVING**",

His legacy will not be measured in years, but in the lives he touched and the doors he opened.\n\n**Personal Stories**  \nI’ll never forget the morning after my father passed—Johnathan was the first to arrive at our home, not with words, but with a warm cup of coffee and a gentle hand on my shoulder. He sat with us in silence, listening more than speaking, and in that stillness, he gave us comfort we didn’t know we needed. To his wife, Clara, and their children, he was a devoted husband and father—someone who taught them that love isn’t loud, but deep, steady, and always present.\n\n**Accomplishments**  \nJohnathan was a *courageous*, *generous*, *thoughtful*, *resilient*, and *compassionate* man whose actions spoke louder than any speech. He led with humility, served with purpose, and inspired those around him through quiet consistency. Whether mentoring youth, volunteering at the food bank, or simply showing up for a neighbor in need, he embodied integrity and kindness in every step he took.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nJohnathan may be gone, but his spirit lives on in every smile, every act of kindness, and every heart he touched. May we carry his light forward, one thoughtful choice at a time.  \n\n*\"A kind word can warm more than a cold winter.\"*",

Meditation offers a simple, effective way to manage and reduce stress. Here are the key benefits:\n\n- **Lowers cortisol levels**: Meditation helps reduce the body’s production of cortisol, the primary stress hormone.  \n- **Improves emotional regulation**: Regular practice enhances self-awareness and emotional balance, making it easier to respond calmly to stressful situations.  \n- **Enhances focus and clarity**: By training the mind to stay present, meditation reduces mental clutter and improves decision-making under pressure.  \n- **Promotes better sleep**: Stress often disrupts sleep; meditation helps calm the nervous system, leading to deeper, more restful rest.  \n- **Builds resilience**: Over time, meditation strengthens the brain’s ability to cope with adversity.\n\nA 2014 study published in *Health Psychology* found that participants who practiced mindfulness meditation for just eight weeks showed significantly lower levels of cortisol and reported reduced symptoms of anxiety and stress compared to a control group. The study, led by researchers at the University of California, found that even short daily sessions (10–15 minutes) led to measurable physiological and psychological improvements.\n\nMeditation doesn’t require special equipment or a quiet room—just a few minutes each day can make a meaningful difference. Whether through focused breathing, body scans, or guided meditation, incorporating mindfulness into your routine is a powerful step toward a calmer, more balanced life.\n\nStart small.

From an early age, he was shaped by the values of duty, honor, and self-reliance instilled in him by his father, Augustine Washington. However, it was his marriage to Martha Dandridge Custis in 1751 that profoundly influenced both his personal and professional development. Martha, a woman of strong character and intelligence, brought stability and emotional balance to Washington’s life. She supported his ambitions, encouraged his sense of responsibility, and served as a grounding force during times of uncertainty. Their marriage, rooted in mutual respect and shared values, laid the foundation for a partnership that would endure through decades of public service. Martha’s influence was especially evident in Washington’s commitment to family, discipline, and moral integrity—qualities that later defined his leadership.\n\n**Revolutionary War Leadership**  \nDuring the American Revolutionary War, Washington’s leadership was shaped not only by military strategy but also by his personal relationship with Martha. As commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, Washington faced immense challenges, including shortages, desertions, and the threat of British forces. In moments of crisis—such as the winter at Valley Forge—Martha’s unwavering support provided him with emotional strength. She managed the household and cared for their children, allowing Washington to focus on the war effort without distraction. Her letters to him, filled with encouragement and practical advice, helped sustain his resolve. Moreover, Martha’s belief in the cause of American independence reinforced Washington’s conviction that the revolution was not just a political struggle but a moral one. This deep personal connection gave him a sense of purpose that transcended battlefield victories.\n\n**Presidency**  \nWhen Washington was elected the first President of the United States in 1789, he carried with him the legacy of his marriage to Martha and the lessons learned from his revolutionary years. His presidency was marked by a commitment to unity, stability, and the rule of law—values deeply influenced by Martha’s quiet strength and moral guidance. While he worked closely with figures like Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson, it was Martha’s enduring presence that reminded him of the importance of home, family, and personal virtue. In his Farewell Address, Washington emphasized the dangers of political factionalism and the need for national cohesion—principles that reflected the balance he had cultivated through his relationship with Martha.

It’s in the little things: the way she remembers your favorite coffee order, the way she laughs at your terrible jokes, and the way she just *gets* you — even when you don’t know what you’re feeling.  \n\nI’ll never forget the time we all went camping and [Groom’s Name] tried to teach [Bride’s Name] how to build a fire — only to end up with a smoldering pile of sticks and a very annoyed [Bride’s Name]. But that’s exactly what I love about them — they’re not perfect, but they’re real. And that’s what makes their love so beautiful.  \n\nSo, to [Groom’s Name] and [Bride’s Name] — may your home be full of laughter, your days be filled with adventure, and your love grow stronger with every season.

The interview should include 5 question and answer pairs, and conclude with a short poem by the astronaut to capture the beauty of space.\nQuestion: \nGeneration:\nassistant\n**Interview: Astronaut Dr. Elena Vasquez – Return from Mars Mission \"Ares-7\"**\n\n*Journalist (J):* Dr. Elena Vasquez, thank you for joining us. Your mission to Mars, \"Ares-7,\" concluded just last week. What were the most unexpected challenges you faced during the journey and on the surface?\n\n**Dr. Elena Vasquez (E):** Thank you for having me. The most unexpected challenge was the dust. Martian regolith is fine, electrostatic, and it clings to everything—our suits, our equipment, even our helmets. It wasn’t just a nuisance; it interfered with sensors and caused micro-fractures in solar panels. We had to develop a new cleaning protocol mid-mission.\n\n*J: What major scientific discoveries did your team make during your time on Mars?*\n\n**E:** One of the most exciting findings was evidence of ancient, subsurface water channels beneath the Valles Marineris region. Using ground-penetrating radar, we detected layered deposits that suggest liquid water existed over 3 billion years ago—conditions that could have supported microbial life. That’s a game-changer for astrobiology.\n\n*J: How did the isolation and communication delays affect your mental and emotional well-being?*\n\n**E:** The 20-minute lag between Earth and Mars made real-time communication impossible. It felt like we were speaking to a ghost. We had to rely on our own judgment, which was both empowering and isolating. We implemented daily mindfulness sessions and a shared journaling system to maintain emotional balance. It taught us resilience and deep self-reliance.\n\n*J: Can you describe your first moments upon stepping onto the Martian surface?*\n\n**E:** It was surreal. The sky was a pale, dusty orange, and the horizon stretched endlessly. The silence—no wind, no birds, just the hum of our suit systems—was overwhelming. When I took my first step, I felt like I was standing on the edge of time. It wasn’t just a planet; it felt like a mirror reflecting Earth’s fragility and beauty.\n\n*J: What message do you have for people on Earth who dream of space exploration?*\n\n**E:** I want them to know that space doesn’t belong to any one nation or generation. It belongs to all of us—children, scientists, dreamers. Every question we ask about Mars, about life, about the universe, brings us closer to understanding ourselves. Exploration isn’t just",

The role of amplification and electronic instruments—especially the synthesizer—is correctly highlighted as transformative in both classical and popular music.\n\n3. **Logical Flow**  \n   The paragraph moves logically from technological change to artistic innovation, showing a clear cause-and-effect relationship between technological advancement and musical evolution.\n\n4. **Relevant Examples**  \n   Mentioning the synthesizer provides a concrete example of how technology influenced music, grounding the abstract idea of \"experimentation\" in a tangible innovation.\n\n5. **Appropriate Scope**  \n   The focus on the 20th century and key developments (radio, recording, amplification, electronic instruments) is well-chosen and relevant to the topic.\n\n---\n\n### ❌ Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Lack of Depth in Explanation**  \n   While the facts are correct, the explanation is superficial. For instance:\n   - It does not elaborate on *how* radio changed music consumption (e.g., democratization of access, cultural homogenization, or the rise of mass audiences).\n   - It does not explore specific examples of musical styles (e.g., jazz, rock, electronic music, minimalism) that emerged due to these changes.\n   - The impact of electronic instruments on composers (e.g., Wendy Carlos, Karlheinz Stockhausen) or genres (e.g., ambient, synth-pop) is not mentioned.\n\n2. **Missing Contextual Nuance**  \n   The text presents a largely positive view of technological progress without acknowledging potential downsides, such as:\n   - The commercialization of music.\n   - The loss of live performance intimacy.\n   - Cultural or regional disparities in access to new technologies.\n\n3. **Underdeveloped \"Freedom and Experimentation\" Claim**  \n   The phrase \"new freedom and wide experimentation\" is vague.
