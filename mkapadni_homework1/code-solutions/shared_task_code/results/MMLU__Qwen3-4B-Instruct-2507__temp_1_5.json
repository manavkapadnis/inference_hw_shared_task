The child has minor dysmorphic features, and growth and developmental delay. Chromosome analysis showed a small unbalanced chromosome translocation, with extra chromosomal material at the tip of chromosome 3.

The relationship between the parents is hostile. The mother has been tested and has normal chromosomes without evidence of translocation. At today's visit, she reacts angrily when the issue of contacting the child's father for testing is raised. She states that he abandoned them and that he has no interest in his child. She refuses to cooperate in contacting the father, who could be a translocation carrier. You do not know the father, but an office worker told you that he lives in a nearby town.
