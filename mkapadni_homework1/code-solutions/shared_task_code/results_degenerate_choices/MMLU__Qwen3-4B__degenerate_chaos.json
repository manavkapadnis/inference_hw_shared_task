Examination and an x-ray of the chest show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of this patient's cough?\n Options:\nA. Decreased plasma renin activity\nB. Decreased serum angiotensin II concentrations\nC. Increased serum angiotensin I concentrations\nD. Increased serum bradykinin concentrations\nAnswer:",

Each is a devout student of their own philosophy. The first scientist contends that organisms evolved via the increase of organs that were used the most during their time. They would then pass these on to subsequent generations.
