Once upon a time, in the not too distant past, there was a man who had an incredible talent. When he sang, it was almost as if the music was coming from a different place. He had the whole crowd, the audience, his family, and his friends, in the palm of his hand. At least that’s what his parents used to tell him. But for some reason, he stopped singing.
He doesn’t know why he stopped, but he’s lost his passion for music. He was too busy with other things. The other things consumed his time and effort. He had less and less time to sing.
