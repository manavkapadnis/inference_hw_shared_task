The capital of France is, of course, Paris. But the city is home to a variety of international communities that offer something to all kinds of people. Whether you're interested in food and drink, shopping, culture and theatre, or art and photography, Paris has something to offer everyone and somewhere for everyone to be.
The food in Paris varies wildly too. From traditional French to new world flavours, there is plenty of food for everyone.
The art and photography scene in Paris is quite extensive, but if you're looking for a high level of contemporary or large pieces, the Louvre is the place to be.
