      "## Question: A police officer carries out hundreds of traffic stops every year. When his supervisor is reviewing the officer’s records for the past year, he notices that the officer is equally likely to stop people of various genders, ages, and races. However, he is significantly more likely to write tickets for middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes. When confronted with this fact, the officer truthfully states that he has no idea why that is, and that it must simply be a coincidence. Unbeknownst to the officer, this behavior is tied to the fact that these men look like his father, with whom he had an abusive relationship as a child.

      "The world record for the mile race in 1886 was set by Walter George on August 23, during a highly publicized race at Lillie Bridge in London. He completed the mile in a remarkable time of 4:12.8, which was reported as 4:12¾ at the time. This achievement was particularly significant as it marked the first time a human had completed the mile in under 4 minutes and 13 seconds, and the record stood unbroken for nearly 30 years, showcasing its historical importance in the realm of athletics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The race attracted a large crowd of approximately 20,000 spectators, indicating the level of excitement and interest in the sport at that time. Walter George's primary competitor in this race was William Cummings, with whom he had a notable rivalry. George's victory in this match solidified his reputation as one of the premier middle-distance runners of his era.\n",
      "\n",
