There are shorter paths that were not considered.  \n   For example:  \n   - Path `[0, 3]` directly: 31 (0\u21923) \u2192 weight = 31.  \n   - Path `[0, 2, 1, 3]`: 288 (0\u21922) + 452 (2\u21921) + 633 (1\u21923) = 1373.  \n   - Path `[0, 1, 0, 3]`: 425 (0\u21921) + 17 (1\u21920) + 373 (0\u21923) = 815.  \n   - Path `[0, 2, 0, 3]`: 288 (0\u21922) + 610 (2\u21920) + 373 (0\u21923) = 1271.  \n   - Path `[0, 1, 3]` is 499, which is longer than the direct path `[0, 3]` with weight 31.  \n   - Path `[0, 2, 3]` is 1047, which is also longer than the direct path.  \n\n   Therefore, the direct path `[0, 3]` is the shortest path with weight 31.  \n   There may be other paths with even lower weights, but the direct path is clearly the shortest.\n\n4. **JSON format is correct:**  \n   The JSON is properly formatted with the keys `'paths'` and `'weights'`, and the values are lists of paths and weights.  \n   However, the weights in the current solution are not correctly formatted as a list of numbers. The current format uses strings with arithmetic expressions (`425 + 74 = 499`), which is invalid JSON. It should be a list of numbers: `[499, 1047]`.\n\n**Corrected Solution:**\n```json\n{\"paths\": [[0, 1, 3], [0, 2, 3]], \"weights\": [499, 1047]}\n```",

For example, `0 -> 2 -> 5` is a valid path since there is an edge from 2 to 5.\n   - However, the solution includes paths like `[0, 1, 3, 5]` and `[0, 3, 4, 5]`, which are not valid because there is no direct edge from 3 to 5 with the given weights. The edge from 3 to 5 exists (weight 286), so this path is valid. However, the path `[0, 1, 3, 5]` is valid as it follows the directed edges.\n\n2. **Correctness of Path Weights:**\n   - The weights for the paths are not all correctly calculated.\n   - For example:\n     - `[0, 2, 5]` should have weight `215 (0->2) + 130 (2->5) = 345`, but the solution lists it as 465.\n     - `[0, 3, 5]` should have weight `197 (0->3) + 286 (3->5) = 483`, but the solution lists it as 553.\n     - `[0, 4, 5]` should have weight `114 (0->4) + 239 (4->5) = 353`, but the solution lists it as 517.\n     - `[0, 5]` is a direct edge with weight 121, which is correct.\n\n3. **Shortest Paths:**\n   - The solution includes some paths that are not the shortest. For example:\n     - `[0, 5]` with weight 121 is the shortest path.\n     - `[0, 2, 5]` with weight 345 is shorter than the solution's 465.\n     - `[0, 3, 5]` with weight 483 is shorter than the solution's 553.\n     - `[0, 4, 5]` with weight 353 is shorter than the solution's 517.\n     - The solution includes paths like `[0, 1, 4, 5]` (weight 615) and `[0, 2, 4, 5]` (weight 521), which are not the shortest paths.\n\n4. **JSON Format:**\n   - The JSON format is correct in terms of structure and syntax.\n   - However, the solution includes more paths than necessary and includes some paths that are not the shortest.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Remove all paths that are not the shortest.\n- Correct the weights for the paths that are included.\n- Ensure that only the shortest paths are listed.\n- Verify that all paths are valid according to the directed edges.",

A valid path should not contain cycles and must go from 0 to 4 without revisiting nodes unnecessarily.\n   - The correct paths should be `[0, 2, 4]` and `[0, 1, 4]`, which are valid and do not revisit nodes.\n\n2. **Path Weights:**\n   - The weight for `[0, 2, 4]` is calculated as: 370 (0\u21922) + 519 (2\u21924) = **889**.\n   - The weight for `[0, 1, 4]` is calculated as: 436 (0\u21921) + 251 (1\u21924) = **687**.\n   - The current solution incorrectly states the weights as 759, which is wrong. The correct weights should be 889 and 687.\n\n3. **Shortest Paths:**\n   - The path `[0, 1, 4]` with weight 687 is indeed the shortest path.\n   - The path `[0, 2, 4]` with weight 889 is not the second shortest. There may be a shorter path that was not considered.\n   - The correct second shortest path is `[0, 3, 1, 4]` with weight: 418 (0\u21923) + 489 (3\u21921) + 251 (1\u21924) = **1158**, but this is longer than 687.\n   - However, there is a shorter path: `[0, 3, 0, 4]` is invalid due to the cycle, but `[0, 3, 1, 4]` is valid and has a higher weight than 687.\n   - The correct second shortest path is actually `[0, 1, 4]` (687), and there is no second distinct shortest path with a lower weight. The current solution incorrectly lists two paths with the same weight of 759, which is not accurate.\n\n4. **JSON Format:**\n   - The JSON format is **correct** in structure.\n   - The paths should be corrected to valid, non-cyclic paths.\n   - The weights should be updated to the correct values.\n\n**Corrected Solution:**\n```json\n{\"paths\": [[0, 1, 4], [0, 2, 4]], \"weights\": [687, 889]}\n```",

These paths revisit node 0, which is unnecessary and likely incorrect.\n\n2. **Are the path weights correctly calculated?**  \n   - The weights for all paths are incorrectly calculated as 1326. This suggests a mistake in the algorithm used to compute the path weights. For example, the path `[0, 3, 5]` has a weight of 394 (from 0\u21923) + 128 (from 3\u21925) = **522**, not 1326.

The actual shortest path from 0 to 5 is likely `[0, 2, 3, 5]` with a weight of 352 + 46 + 128 = **526**, or `[0, 3, 5]` with a weight of 394 + 128 = **522**, which is shorter.\n\n4. **Is the JSON format correct?**  \n   - The JSON format is correct in structure, but the values are incorrect.

For example:\n     - Path `[0, 3, 5]`: 351 (0\u21923) + 128 (3\u21925) = **479**, not 522.\n     - Path `[0, 2, 3, 5]`: 352 (0\u21922) + 472 (2\u21923) + 128 (3\u21925) = **952**, not 526.\n     - Path `[0, 2, 5]`: 352 (0\u21922) + 907 (2\u21925) = **1259**, not 1326.\n     - Path `[0, 1, 4, 5]`: 695 (0\u21921) + 142 (1\u21924) + 287 (4\u21925) = **1124**, not 1326.\n     - Path `[0, 3, 4, 5]`: 351 (0\u21923) + 714 (3\u21924) + 287 (4\u21925) = **1352**, not 1326.\n     - Paths like `[0, 1, 0, 3, 5]` and `[0, 1, 0, 2, 5]` include cycles (0\u21921\u21920), which are not allowed in shortest path problems unless explicitly permitted, but they are not minimal and likely incorrect.\n\n3. **Are these actually the shortest paths?**  \n   - No. The solution includes paths that are not the shortest. For example:\n     - The shortest path from 0 to 5 is likely **0 \u2192 2 \u2192 3 \u2192 5** with a total weight of **352 + 472 + 128 = 952**.\n     - However, the path **0 \u2192 3 \u2192 5** is shorter at **351 + 128 = 479**, which is the shortest path.\n     - The path **0 \u2192 2 \u2192 5** is **352 + 907 = 1259**, which is longer than 479.\n     - The path **0 \u2192 1 \u2192 4 \u2192 5** is **695 + 142 + 287 = 1124**, which is longer than 479.\n     - The path **0 \u2192 3 \u2192 4 \u2192 5** is **351 + 714 + 287 = 1352**, which is much longer.\n     - The paths with cycles (e.g., 0 \u2192 1 \u2192 0 \u2192 3 \u2192 5) are not valid or optimal.\n\n4. **Is the JSON format correct?**  \n   - The JSON format is correct in terms of structure and syntax. The keys `'paths'` and `'weights'` are present, and the values are lists of lists and numbers, respectively.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Correct the weights for each path based on the actual edge weights.\n- Remove any paths that include cycles or are not minimal.\n- Ensure that the shortest path(s) are identified and only those are included in the output.\n- The shortest path is likely **[0, 3, 5]** with weight **479**, and possibly **[0, 2, 3, 5]** with weight **952**, but **[0, 3, 5]** is clearly the shortest.",

Here is the detailed feedback:\n\n1. **Are the paths valid from source to destination?**  \n   - The path [0, 2, 3] is valid. It starts at node 0, goes to node 2, then to node 3, which is the destination. So this is a valid path.\n\n2. **Are the path weights correctly calculated?**  \n   - The weight of the path [0, 2, 3] is calculated as:  \n     0 \u2192 2: 114  \n     2 \u2192 3: 98  \n     Total: 114 + 98 = **212**  \n     This is correct.\n\n3. **Are these actually the shortest paths?**  \n   - No. The solution is missing the shortest path.  \n     The shortest path from 0 to 3 is [0, 1, 3], with a total weight of:  \n     0 \u2192 1: 50  \n     1 \u2192 3: 34  \n     Total: 50 + 34 = **84**  \n     This is shorter than 212.\n\n   - Another possible path is [0, 1, 2, 3], with weight:  \n     0 \u2192 1: 50  \n     1 \u2192 2: 217  \n     2 \u2192 3: 98  \n     Total: 50 + 217 + 98 = **365** (longer than 84).\n\n   - The path [0, 2, 3] is not the shortest. The correct shortest path is [0, 1, 3].\n\n4. **Is the JSON format correct?**  \n   - Yes, the JSON format is correct. The keys 'paths' and 'weights' are present, and the values are properly formatted as lists of lists and lists of numbers, respectively.\n\n### Corrected Solution:\n```json\n{\"paths\": [[0, 1, 3]], \"weights\": [84]}\n```",
